**1-What is JavaScript?**

**JavaScript** is the **programming language of the Web**.  
It allows developers to create **interactive**, **dynamic**, and **responsive** web pages.

With JavaScript, you can:
- ✅ **Manipulate HTML and CSS** to change how a page looks and behaves.  
- 🧮 **Process, calculate, and validate data** directly in the browser.  
- 🔄 **Update content dynamically** without reloading the page.

In short, JavaScript brings **life** to otherwise static web pages. ✨

💬 **1. Interactive**

The user can interact with the page, not just see it.

For example:

When you click on buttons and a pop-up window opens (e.g. mobile menu or modal login).

When you hover over a product card and a hover animation is played.

When you fill out a form and JavaScript checks that it is not empty.

When the image slider works with the left and right buttons.

📍 Summary:

JavaScript helps the page respond to the user.

⚡ **2. Dynamic**

The page can change without refreshing.

For example:

When the price of products on the site changes without refreshing the page.

When a new message appears automatically in an online chat (e.g. web).

When the list of articles expands by clicking "Load More".

When user ratings or timers are updated live.

📍 Summary:
JavaScript changes data and content live.

📱 **3. Responsive**

The page adapts to different widths and devices, such as mobile, tablet, or desktop.

(In "Responsive", it refers to CSS design, but JavaScript helps make the behavior of elements responsive.)

For example:

A mobile menu that opens and closes with JavaScript.

A gallery of images that slides on mobile.

Adjusting the size or layout of content based on the width of the browser.

📍 Summary:
JavaScript makes the behavior of the page change depending on the device or screen size.
